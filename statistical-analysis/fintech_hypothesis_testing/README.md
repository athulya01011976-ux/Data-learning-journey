# Fintech Hypothesis Testing – Credit Policy Impact

## Project Overview
This project analyzes whether a new credit approval policy reduced loan default rates in a fintech company using statistical hypothesis testing.

The goal is to demonstrate **practical statistical reasoning**, correct **test selection**, and **business-focused interpretation**.

## Business Problem
A fintech company introduced a stricter credit approval policy to reduce loan defaults.  
Management wants to know whether the observed reduction in default rate after the policy change is **statistically significant** or due to random variation.

## Approach
- Defined null and alternative hypotheses in business terms  
- Selected an appropriate hypothesis test for binary outcome data  
- Interpreted the p-value from a business decision perspective

  ## Data Note
**The dataset used in this project is AI-simulated** to reflect realistic fintech default behavior.  
The statistical solution and interpretations were **reviewed, corrected, and refined** to ensure methodological accuracy and clarity.
