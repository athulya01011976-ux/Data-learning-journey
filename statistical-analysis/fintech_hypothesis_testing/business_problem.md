## Business Context (Fintech Company)

You are a statistician at a fintech company that provides digital loans and credit cards through a mobile app.

The company recently introduced a new credit approval policy:

A stricter risk-scoring threshold

Aimed at reducing loan default rates

Management has collected 6 months of data before and 6 months of data after the policy change.

## Available data

- Loan default indicator (Default / No Default)
- Loan amount
- Customer credit score
- Policy period (Before / After)
- Customer segment (New vs Existing)

## Business Problem

Management wants to know:

- Did the new credit approval policy actually reduce the default rate, or are the observed changes due to random variation?

This decision is critical because:

- A stricter policy may reduce defaults
- But it may also reduce customer acquisition and revenue
- They ask you to perform hypothesis testing to support a data-driven decision.
