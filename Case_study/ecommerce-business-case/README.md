Project Description

This file contains a business case simulation where I played the role of a data analyst working with an e-commerce startup.

The business problem was intentionally ambiguous to reflect real-world stakeholder conversations.

I focused on:

Asking clarification questions

Defining metrics

Structuring an analysis plan

Problem statements were simulated using AI to mimic real client ambiguity; all analysis framing and structuring is my own.
