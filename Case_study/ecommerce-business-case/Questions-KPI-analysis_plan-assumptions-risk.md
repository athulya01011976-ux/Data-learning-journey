## success metrics / KPIs:
1. Repeat purchase rate: tells us the customer satisfaction and loyalty

3. Customer retention rate: measures long-term
sustainability
4. Gross margin of the product: identify the true profitability
5. Year-over-year revenue growth: separating real growth from seasonality
