This repository contains my SQL preparation work, focused on solving real-world business problems using SQL.

The questions are designed to simulate actual interview scenarios , covering both fundamental and advanced SQL concepts.

### Data Model Used

A company HR + sales domain is used throughout the repository to maintain.

### How This Was Built:

Problems were practiced incrementally, from easy to advanced

Queries were reviewed and corrected with interviewer-style feedback

Focus was on:

Accuracy

Edge cases

Interview-readiness

Clear, readable SQL

Some practice questions and datasets were AI-assisted to simulate interviewer-style questions,
while all SQL solutions, reasoning, and improvements are my own work.
